# Benchmark Documentation

Comprehensive benchmarking suite for `atom-effect` to measure performance and detect regressions.

## Overview

The benchmark suite consists of:

- **Micro-benchmarks**: Test individual operations (atom, computed, effect, batch, untracked)
- **Macro-benchmarks**: Test real-world scenarios (todo app, data grid, dependency graphs, memory stress)

## Running Benchmarks

### Quick Start

```bash
# Run all benchmarks
pnpm bench

# Run only micro-benchmarks
pnpm bench:micro

# Run only macro-benchmarks
pnpm bench:macro
```

### Specific Benchmarks

```bash
# Run atom benchmarks
pnpm bench:atom

# Run computed benchmarks
pnpm bench:computed

# Run effect benchmarks
pnpm bench:effect
```

## Benchmark Categories

### Micro-Benchmarks

Located in `__benchmarks__/micro/`, these test individual primitive operations:

#### Atom Benchmarks

- Creation (primitive, object, batch)
- Read operations (value, peek)
- Write operations (single, multiple)
- Subscription management
- Disposal

#### Computed Benchmarks

- Creation with various dependency counts
- Dependency tracking
- Recomputation efficiency
- Lazy evaluation
- Cache invalidation

#### Effect Benchmarks

- Creation and execution
- Dependency tracking
- Re-execution on changes
- Cleanup handling
- Disposal

#### Batch Benchmarks

- Batch vs non-batch updates
- Nested batches
- Batch with computed values

#### Untracked Benchmarks

- Untracked reads
- Mixed tracked/untracked operations
- Performance comparison

### Macro-Benchmarks

Located in `__benchmarks__/macro/`, these test real-world scenarios:

#### Todo App

- Create 100 todos
- Toggle completion status
- Filter (all/active/completed)
- Delete todos
- Complete workflow simulation

#### Data Grid

- 1000 rows × 10 columns
- Sorting by different fields
- Filtering by department
- Pagination
- Combined operations

#### Dependency Graphs

- Deep chains (100+ levels)
- Wide fan-out (1 → 100 dependents)
- Diamond dependencies
- Pyramid patterns
- Dynamic dependencies

#### Memory Stress

- Create/dispose 10K atoms
- GC pressure tests
- Memory leak detection
- Object pooling stress
- Large state trees

## Interpreting Results

Benchmark results show:

- **Operations per second (ops/sec)**: Higher is better
- **Mean time**: Average time per operation
- **Margin of error**: Statistical variance
- **Percentiles (p75, p95, p99)**: Distribution of execution times
